## About Me

I’m a passionate coder who believes that code isn’t just about functions and variables—it's about making an impact. Whether I’m building with a team or hacking away on solo projects, I dive deep, learn fast, and never settle for “just okay.”

🛠️ **What drives me?**  
- Turning tea and snacks into code  
- Solving real-world problems  
- Constantly leveling up my skills  
- Collaborating with creative minds

🌟 **Currently working at [Senja Solutions](https://senja.co.uk)** — building awesome stuff and learning every day!

## Beyond Code

When I’m not in front of the screen, you’ll catch me:  
🎬 Watching movies & geeking out over cinematography  
📚 Reading (and sometimes writing) books  
🎮 Gaming to unwind or spark inspiration
